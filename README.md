# About Me 🦉


**Irvin-S16/irvin-s16** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on myself to become someone like Sir Jem or Sir Kevin one day.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Github and Python to hopefully pass CS11.
- 🤔 I’m someone who likes to learn things.
- 🈳 마부하이! My love for Korean media led me to learning their language.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I learned HTML, CSS, JS at SoloLearn but it did not stick around my mind.
